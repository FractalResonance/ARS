## Mathematical Framework Summary

### FRC Core Calculations
1. **Cosmic Flux Map F(λ)**:
   ```
   F(λ) = 1 + G(250,20,0.25) + G(310,15,0.18) + G(270,18,0.15) 
            - G(80,25,0.20) - G(35,25,0.10)
   ```

2. **Latitude Gain g(φ)**:
   ```
   g(φ) = 1 + 0.15 * (1 - cos(φ)⁴)
   ```

3. **RPI Vector Components**:
   - **Pressure**: Σ(weight_i × F(longitude_i))
   - **Tension**: Calculated from active aspects with hard aspect weighting
   - **Magnitude**: √(P² + T²)

### Planetary Weight System
- **Luminaries**: Sun, Moon (1.0)
- **Personal**: Mercury, Venus (0.8)
- **Social**: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (0.7)
- **Transpersonal**: Uranus (0.5), Neptune (0.4), Pluto (0.3)
- **Node**: North Node (0.6)

## Technical Architecture
