# ARS v0.2 Upgrade - House System Implementation

## Date: 2025-07-26
## Upgrade Directive: House System Calculation

## Completed Upgrades

### 1. Version Update
- Updated ARS version from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

### 2. New Data Models Added
- **HouseCusps**: Model for 12 house cusp longitudes
- **PlanetHouseMapping**: Model mapping each planet to its house number
- **NatalChartResponse**: Complete natal chart response model including:
  - Planetary positions
  - House cusps
  - Planet-to-house mappings
  - Ascendant and Midheaven

### 3. New Functions Implemented
- **calculate_houses()**: Uses swisseph.houses_ex() with Placidus system
- **determine_planet_houses()**: Calculates which house each planet occupies
  - Handles houses crossing 0째 Aries correctly

### 4. New API Endpoint
- **POST /v1/natal_chart**
  - Accepts NatalData (year, month, day, hour, minute, lat, lon)
  - Returns complete natal chart with:
    - All planetary positions
    - 12 house cusps (Placidus system)
    - Planet-to-house mappings
    - Special points (Ascendant, Midheaven)

### 5. Testing Results
Test request with sample data (1985-12-08 13:15, Tehran):
- Successfully calculated all house cusps
- Correctly mapped planets to houses
- Ascendant: 76.0992째 (Gemini)
- Midheaven: 325.1299째 (Aquarius)

## Technical Notes
- Placidus house system implemented as default (using b'P' parameter)
- House determination algorithm handles retrograde motion and 0째 crossing
- All calculations use Swiss Ephemeris for maximum precision

## Future Enhancement Opportunity
As suggested in directive: Modify /v1/resonant_weather to accept pre-calculated natal_chart_id for efficiency (not implemented in this upgrade)
