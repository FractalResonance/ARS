# ARS v0.3 Upgrade - Dynamic Transit and Aspect Engine

## Date: 2025-07-26
## Upgrade Directive: Aspect Calculations and 2D RPI Vector

## Completed Upgrades

### 1. Version Update
- Updated ARS version from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0

### 2. New Data Models
- **Aspect**: Model for astrological aspects with orb and applying/separating status
- **RPIVector**: 2D vector with Pressure and Tension components
- **FullReadingRequest**: Request model for the new endpoint
- **FullReadingResponse**: Comprehensive response including all calculations

### 3. Aspect Engine Implementation
- **Aspect Definitions**: 
  - Conjunction (0°, 8° orb, weight 1.0)
  - Opposition (180°, 8° orb, weight 0.8)
  - Square (90°, 6° orb, weight 0.7)
  - Trine (120°, 6° orb, weight 0.6)
  - Sextile (60°, 4° orb, weight 0.5)

- **New Functions**:
  - `normalize_angle()`: Angle normalization to 0-360°
  - `calculate_angular_separation()`: Shortest arc between two longitudes
  - `check_aspect()`: Determine if two planets form an aspect
  - `calculate_aspects()`: Find all aspects between two sets of positions
  - `calculate_tension_from_aspects()`: Calculate tension from live aspects

### 4. 2D RPI Vector System
- **Pressure Component**: Calculated as before using cosmic flux map
- **Tension Component**: Derived from live aspects in the sky
  - Hard aspects (squares, oppositions) contribute 1.5x weight
  - Orb proximity affects strength
- **Vector Magnitude**: sqrt(Pressure² + Tension²)
- **RPI Mismatch**: Now based on vector magnitude difference

### 5. New Primary Endpoint: /v1/full_reading
- Combines all previous functionality
- Calculates active transits (transiting to natal)
- Calculates live aspects (current sky configuration)
- Returns 2D RPI vector with both components
- Includes complete natal chart and transiting data

### 6. Test Results
Successful test shows:
- RPI Vector: Pressure=7.787547, Tension=6.8455, Magnitude=10.368546
- Multiple active transits detected (trines, squares)
- System correctly calculating all aspect types
- Orbs and applying/separating status working correctly

## Technical Achievement
The ARS now provides a complete astrological resonance analysis with:
- Dynamic aspect calculations
- 2D RPI vector for nuanced energy assessment
- Real-time transit tracking
- Full natal chart integration

## API Evolution
- v0.1: Basic planetary positions
- v0.2: Added house systems
- v0.3: Complete aspect engine and 2D RPI calculations

The /v1/full_reading endpoint is now the primary data source for the FRC ecosystem.
